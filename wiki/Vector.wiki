Currently, a [Vector] is just a table containing 3 variables, x, y, and z.

Vector can be called as a function to create a new vector:

Vector(x (number),y (number),z (number) )

*Vector functions include:*

 * [vAdd]
 * [vSub]
 * [vMul]
 * [Vector]
 * [VectorNormalize]
 * [VectorLength]
 * [VectorForward]
 * [VectorRight]
 * [VectorUp]
 * [TraceLine]
